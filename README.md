# Hello, I'm Gino.  ðŸ‘‹ ![profile views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=viztea)

I was born in California about 18 years ago but I've only been coding for ~5 years and I've mainly been focusing on developing Discord Applications but I've also created many APIs, Websites, Applications, and open-source libraries.
JavaScript was the first language I learned and I used it for a couple of years but [Kotlin](https://kotl.in) and [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) have taken over my life <3 but I do dabble in Golang and Rust from time to time.

# Hello, I'm Gino.  👋 ![profile views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=melike2d)

I'm an 18-year-old that was born and raised in California 🐻.   
I've been coding since I was 13, I did some scripting before that but we don't talk about it :)

---

These past _5 years_ I've mainly been focusing on developing Discord Applications but since then I've also created many NPM packages, Websites, APIs, and other things.
I started out with JavaScript but have moved on to languages such as [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), Rust, and Golang.

##### The best way to contact me is through the Dimensional Fun discord server [**here**](https://discord.gg/8R4d8RydT4).

##### You can hire me to create a Discord Bot, DM me on Discord @Gino#0001!

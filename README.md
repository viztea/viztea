# Hello, I'm Gino.  üëã ![profile views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=melike2d)

I'm a 16 y/o that was born and rasied in California üêª.   
I've been coding since I was 13, I did some scripting before that but we don't talk about it :)

Discord bots and anything discord related has been my primary focus these _3 and a half years_, since then I've created NPM packages, Websites, and APIs.
I've also learned multiple languages like **Kotlin** and **Rust**.
